-----------------------------

Problem 1.4 of Machine Leraning course of MIIS at UPF.

** Aknowledgement **
This is heavily inspired (if not copied) from http://datasciencelab.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/machine-learning-classics-the-perceptron/.

** execution **
Clone and execute it from the command line with "python perceptron.py 20" :)

** requirements **
Install (with pip) Pillow and images2gif

** important **
As explained here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19149643/error-in-images2gif-py-with-globalpalette I had to modify the line 426 of images2gif.py fot this code to work.
